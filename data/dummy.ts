    `If submission were natural to women, there wouldn’t be thousands of sermons everyday reminding women to submit because nature doesn’t need reminders to run its course. These reminders exist because indoctrination depends on constant reinforcement to keep harmful ideologies alive.\n`,
    `People keep talking about duties within marriage. I’ve never viewed my marriage this way. I married the love of my life because I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. We’re equals. Our relationship is not transactional. We’re building a life together. It’s not a trial.\n`,
    `Lastly, your woman stepping out on you doesn’t mean she doesn’t love you anymore or that she wants the relationship to end. Don’t stigmatize her, It just happened and it’s life. Be a man, forgive and forget. Let bygones be bygones. May God help all of us. 🤍\n`,
    `It’s the mentally that men have that have them cheating all over the place. Who told you the girlfriend doesn’t want to be foked like that? Don’t worry, she will meet someone that will bend her like rubber band since you think she’s porcelain.\n`,
    `Motherhood is a duty to the state has to be one of the foulest sentences I’ve ever heard. Let’s pretend it’s true though, what is the state’s duty to mothers? Universal healthcare, a living wage for all jobs, free daycare and free college for those 11 kids. 

  Get fucking real.\n`,
    `Personally, I don’t see how anyone can observe how hard it is for women to get out of abusive marriages in this country and still advocate for them to be financially dependent on men because “choice.” Imagine not having your own means to at least move out. It is insane.\n`,
    `For centuries, women have changed where they go, what they wear, how they speak, who they associate with yet women are still dying at the hands of men

  There’s only so much you can do in a society that’s hell bent on harming women
  
  Tell men to stop harming women !\n`,
    `This is why I can’t date anyone who 
  1. Can’t cook 
  2. Can cook but think it’s beneath him or it’s the role of a woman
  3. Can cook but wouldn’t because  “it’s why he has a woman”\n`,
    `Them: “women, God created you to be a wife & mother, it doesn’t matter if you wear rags and your children eat mud, working outside the home is a sin”

  IN THE SAME CAPTION:
  “Click the link in my bio to get my ebook for $30 to learn how I eat mud in contentment”.\n`,
    `“Don’t worry, a man will still marry & humble you. People have said worse, and now they’re quiet in their husband’s house” so you admit that marriage is a regressive institution of oppression meant to humble, silence & suck the life out of women? Glad we are on the same page.\n`,
